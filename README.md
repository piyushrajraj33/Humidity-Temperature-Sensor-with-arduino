# Humidity-Temperature-Sensor-with-arduino
In this project we are going to discuss how to connect dht11 (Humidity /Temperature Sensor) with arduino micro-controller .We will be getting the environment temperature and and humidity level in environment on the Serial Monitor of arduino IDE.

Itâ€™s accurate enough for most projects that need to keep track of humidity and temperature readings.

Again we will be using a Library specifically designed for these sensors that will make our code short and easy to write.

As you can see we only need 3 connections to the sensor, since one of the pin is not used.

The connection are : Voltage, Ground and Signal which can be connected to any Analog Pin on our UNO.


THE CODE

Since we will be using a Library that is available for this sensor, our code will be very short and simple.

Once you have the library, just go ahead and extract it to the Library folder inside your Arduino IDE software folder.

Library and code is atteched  in the folder.
